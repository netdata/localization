## 1. General Information Regarding These Terms of Use

Master terms: Welcome, and thank you for your interest in Netdata (“Netdata,” “ND,” “we,” “our,” or “us”).

These include https://my-netdata.io and https://netdata.cloud, together with all other subdomains thereof, (collectively, the “Websites”). The Master Terms also apply to all products, information, and services provided through the Websites, such as the NDID Login Service.

Additional terms: In addition to the Master Terms, your use of any Services may also be subject to specific terms applicable to a particular Service (“Additional Terms”). If there is any conflict between the Additional Terms and the Master Terms, then the Additional Terms apply in relation to the relevant Service.

Collectively, the Terms: The Master Terms, together with any Additional Terms, form a binding legal agreement between you and Netdata in relation to your use of the Services. Collectively, this legal agreement is referred to below as the “Terms.”

Human-readable summary of Sec 1: These terms, together with any special terms for particular websites, create a contract between you and Netdata. The contract governs your use of all websites operated by Netdata, unless a particular website indicates otherwise. These human-readable summaries of each section are not part of the contract, but are intended to help you understand its terms.

All new and/or revised Terms take effect immediately and apply to your use of the Services from that date on, except that material changes will take effect 30 days after the change is made and identified as material. Your continued use of any Services after new and/or revised Terms are effective indicates that you have read, understood, and agreed to those Terms.
